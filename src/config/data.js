      "In today’s technical environment many latest technologies are being experienced by mankind, and the internet being one of the fastest-growing infrastructures has become a necessity. But due to the emerging technologies, we are unable to safeguard our private information in an effective manner which is giving rise to cybercrimes day by day. Today more than 60% of commercial transactions are done online which makes cyber security the field for transparent and secure transactions and an important asset of the risk management approach. In this article, I would like to stress on my conceptualization of the risk management approach and the reason why I have chosen to adopt an integral part of the cyber security risk management approach and the resulting profile. What is cyber security? is the question that might have arisen in anyone’s mind reading this article; so let me simplify it for you, cyber security or also known as IT security is the practice of protecting the critical systems or databases and the sensitive information from digital attacks or cybercrimes that may originate from inside or outside the organization. Now what is the reason behind a cyber-attack or how do cyber attacks take place? truly speaking there is no specific answer to this, there can be a variety of methods to launch a cyber-attack but the goal is commonly to steal data, disable computers or achieve financial gain.",
    paragraph:"Cyber-attacks are either criminally or politically motivated and the adversaries can be either a private person, a state actor, or a criminal organization, some of the most famous examples of cybercrimes or the mafia boy denial of service attack in 2000 which caused estimated damage of $1.7 Billion to the affected sites and the Wanna-Cry attack in 2017 which demanded bitcoin to unlock the files and also contrived critical organization’s like the National Health Service (NHS) in the UK. Ways to prevent a cyber-attack! learning about how cyber attacks take place and the most common tactics used, one can take appropriate precautions like backup data, choose multi-factor authentication, update systems, use firewalls and antivirus, etc. It is good to know that India is emerging as a global IT superpower, asserting, firm measures to safeguard data privacy and online rights of its citizens and has also made it to the top 10 Global Cyber security Index (GCI) 2020 and has moved up by 37 places to rank as the tenth best country in the world on key cyber-safety parameters.", 
    subparagraph:"What are the upcoming challenges in the field of cyber-security? the ever-changing landscape of emerging technologies and the demanding job of businesses to secure their networks with the large-scale IoT, and the emerging 5G technologies are encouraging all the important decision-makers in the company and their IT departments to enhance their cyber-security infrastructure and also to provide relevant training to their employees of how to act in case of a cyber-crime. As per the latest statics released by the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB), Mumbai ranked third nationwide in terms of cybercrimes committed in 2020, Bengaluru, Silicon Valley of India topped the list followed by Hyderabad. The types of cyber-attacks nowadays include: Blockchain and crypto currency attacks, now as the world of blockchain and crypto is going rapidly and attracting more interest than ever. Phishing Scams, are an online scam that targets customers by sending them an email that appears to be from a well-known source, there are several tips that customers can follow to avoid such scams like not-responding to e-mails or pop-up messages that ask for personal or financial information eg: credit card details.",
    lastp:"The government of India has added several measures for cybercrimes like the Information Technology (IT) Act of 2000 the act provides a legal framework for electronic governance by giving recognition to electronic records and digital signatures. It also defines cyber crimes and prescribes penalties for them. The Act directed the formation of a Controller of Certifying Authorities to regulate the issuance of digital signatures, Things of cyber-security Act 2020, the act creates security standards for IoT devices and encompasses other IT issues, putting in place at least some degree of protection for IoT devices and their use. While these acts may not be enough, but it's certainly a step in the right direction. In conclusion, I would like to say that computer security is a vast topic that is becoming more important because the world is becoming highly interconnected with networks spread wide across and being used to carry out critical transactions. Cybercrime continues to diverge down the paths with each New Year that passes and so does the security of the information along with the cyber tools and threats that come to light each passing day hereby challenging organizations and businesses to secure their assets or face the consequences, according to me there is no perfect solution for cyber cries but we should try our level best to minimize the number of cyber-attacks with the help of new platforms and intelligence in order to have a safe and secure future in cyberspace.",

    description:
      "Python is a high-level, general-purpose and very popular programming language. The latest version (python 3) is being used in Web development, Machine learning, and Deep Learning applications like used for building neural networks which relate to the study of artificial intelligence. Python is an easy-to-learn, and widely used multi-purpose with dynamic semantics. This allows for rapid software development and has also been used as a glue language to connect existing components. Python supports modules and packages, which encourages program modularity and code reuse which are some of it’s important features. Python is often picked because of its productivity without compilation steps. Debugging programs is easy because the interpreter catches errors instead of causing a segmentation fault. The debugging at the source level allows for inspecting local and global variables, evaluation of arbitrary expressions, setting breakpoints etc. It's often quicker to use print statements than using the debugger; the fast edit-test-debug cycle makes this simple approach effective.",
    paragraph:"With Python, programmers can choose between the object-oriented and procedural paradigms. Python programs are generally smaller than Java programs, giving programmers type less and making it easier to read. Nowadays, Python is being used by almost all tech-giant companies like Google, Amazon, Facebook, Instagram, Dropbox, and Uber etc. to upgrade their systems. The biggest strength of Python when compared to other programming languages is its huge collection of standard library functions. The library has options specifically designed to increase the portability of your code, such as an escape module that gives your program more accessible to the system. Python is provided as a variety of packages for most operating systems. Python is used as standalone applications and web services. The programming is not the fastest, but it’s versatile enough to make up for any deficiencies. Using Python allows for easier processing, for instance, as it is capable of multitasking. Sophisticated data analysis is an essential power and interface to most machine learning libraries. Python’s popularity is also largely due to its vast library of modules for computer programming and other mathematical calculations used for complex algorithms. Python can also be used to drive code-generation systems such as LLVM, to efficiently create code in other languages. Python’s syntactical elements express many common program flows which are meant to be readable and clean just like a standard “hello world in python is one of the easiest syntaxes ever known. print(“Hello world!”);", 
    subparagraph:"The Python programming language is a dynamically typed object-oriented programming language. You don't have to implement code to track and release objects. Garbage collection happens automatically in most cases while in other it may raise an issue, in such cases one can trigger it manually or disable it entirely or create whole regions of objects exempt from garbage collection which is one of the biggest concerns of the developers when it comes to the performance of the language. Is Python slow? Is one of the most common questions trending nowadays, yes python programs generally run more slowly than competitors like Java or C/C++, the Python language might not be as fast as competing languages due to the need to interpret rather than compile. But there are many ways to reduce this slowdown, such as compiling libraries or producing bytecode.",
    lastp:"The speed difference between Python compared to other languages is less noticeable when working on software with high throughput and high concurrency demands. However, for many real-world applications, Python will provide a good balance between speed and the flexibility and pace of development that it provides which may allow for innovation that would be more difficult or time-consuming without Python. The good news for python developers is all thanks to the new release of the already speedy PyPy interpreter that promises to be the fastest version yet. Improvements in PyPy include better performance in handling long types, tweaks to the JIT compiler that improve data allocation, and more. But when the speed of development and programmer comfort are more important than shaving a few seconds off the machine clock, Python may well be the best tool for the job!",

    description:
      "Data science is a field that extracts insights and knowledge from data, to use in a broad range of contexts. It uses interdisciplinary methods, processes, and algorithms. Data science is an umbrella category for disciplines that include statistics, data analysis, machine learning and its closely related methods. The purpose of data science is to understand a subject through the use of data. Data science has been a booming field in recent years. Data science professionals have been sought by many companies for solving business complexities. Thus the job role of a can be defined as “A data scientist is a statistician who can code.” Data science is the study of how data can be used and analyzed in order to make new discoveries or can also be simply defined as “the discipline of making the data useful.”",
    paragraph:"Data science encompasses a broad range of data-related techniques and skills, from advanced analytics to ethics. In order to be an effective data scientist, one must also have concern for infrastructure development and pragmatics. The field requires high levels of scientific knowledge and skill in order to work with data sets in the real world. Data science involves principles, processes, and techniques for understanding phenomena via the (automated) analysis of data. From the perspective of this article, the ultimate goal of data science is improving decision-making, as this generally is of paramount interest to business. Data-driven decision-making (DDD) refers to the practice of basing decisions on the analysis of data rather than purely on intuition. For example, a marketer could select advertisements based purely on her long experience in the field and her eye for what will work. Or, she could base her selection on the analysis of data regarding how consumers react to different ads. She could also use a combination of these approaches. DDD is not an all-or-nothing practice, and different firms engage in DDD to greater or lesser degrees.    ", 
    subparagraph:"“Big data” technologies, such as Hadoop, Hbase, CouchDB, and others have received considerable media attention recently. As with traditional technologies, big data technologies are used for many tasks, including data engineering. Occasionally, big data technologies are actually used for implementing data-mining techniques, but more often the well-known big data technologies are used for data processing in support of the data-mining techniques and other data-science activities. One way to think about the state of big data technologies is to draw an analogy with the business adoption of internet technologies. In Web 1.0, businesses busied themselves with getting the basic internet technologies in place so that they could establish a web presence, build electronic commerce capability, and improve operating efficiency. We can think of ourselves as being in the era of Big Data 1.0, with firms engaged in building capabilities to process large data. Managers in enterprises without substantial data-science resources should still understand basic principles in order to engage consultants on an informed basis. Investors in data-science ventures need to understand the fundamental principles in order to assess investment opportunities accurately. More generally, businesses increasingly are driven by data analytics, and there is great professional advantage in being able to interact competently with and within such businesses. Understanding the fundamental concepts, and having frameworks for organizing data-analytic thinking, not only will allow one to interact competently, but will help to envision opportunities for improving data-driven decision making or to see data-oriented competitive threats.",
    lastp:"Underlying the extensive collection of techniques for mining data is a much smaller set of fundamental concepts comprising data science. In order for data science to flourish as a field, rather than to drown in the flood of popular attention, we must think beyond the algorithms, techniques, and tools in common use. We must think about the core principles and concepts that underlie the techniques, and also the systematic thinking that fosters success in data-driven decision making. There is strong evidence that business performance can be improved substantially via data-driven decision making, big data technologies, and data-science techniques based on big data. Data science supports data-driven decision making—and sometimes allows making decisions automatically at massive scale—and depends upon technologies for “big data” storage and engineering. However, the principles of data science are its own and should be considered and discussed explicitly in order for data science to realize its potential.",

    category: 'research',
    subCategory: ['AI', 'automation', 'intelligence'],
    description:
      "The use of AI is a phrase that many people are using this time in time. Artificial Intelligence disguises the truth that humans are often as befuddled by AI as society is. Some say that the current era revolves around Artificial Intelligence, but there is much misunderstanding. There are many in academia and industry who believe that AI has the potential to surpass human intelligence and create Machine Superintelligence. The idea is frightening for some, but it's fascinating for others. People often overlook the dangers that exist in AI. One of the most common problems is that humans are confident AI will make accurate decisions, but they fail to account for malfunctioning machines and poor data. In the digital era, industries are being disrupted by Artificial Intelligence (AI). AI is not just a fad but it also has a major impact on how marketers will do their job in the future. Marketers need to be prepared for the changes ahead and learn how to use AI to stay ahead of the curve. We live in a world where innovation is driven by technology and AI has been at the forefront of innovation. It’s time for marketers to get with the times.",
    paragraph:"Most of what is being called “AI” today, particularly in the public sphere, is what has been called “Machine Learning” (ML) for the past several decades. ML is an algorithmic field that blends ideas from statistics, computer science and many other disciplines (see below) to design algorithms that process data, make predictions and help make decisions. We now come to a critical issue: Is working on classical human-imitative AI the best or only way to focus on these larger challenges? Some of the most heralded recent success stories of ML have in fact been in areas associated with human-imitative AI — areas such as computer vision, speech recognition, game-playing and robotics. So perhaps we should simply await further progress in domains such as these. First, although one would not know it from reading the newspapers, success in human-imitative AI has in fact been limited — we are very far from realizing human-imitative AI aspirations. Unfortunately the thrill (and fear) of making even limited progress on human-imitative AI gives rise to levels of over-exuberance and media attention that is not present in other areas of engineering.", 
    subparagraph:"A related argument is that human intelligence is the only kind of intelligence that we know, and that we should aim to mimic it as a first step. But humans are in fact not very good at some kinds of reasoning — we have our lapses, biases and limitations. Moreover, critically, we did not evolve to perform the kinds of large-scale decision-making that modern II systems must not face, nor to cope with the kinds of uncertainty that arise in II contexts. One could argue that an AI system would not only imitate human intelligence, but also “correct” it, and would also scale to arbitrarily large problems. But we are now in the realm of science fiction — such speculative arguments, while entertaining in the setting of fiction, should not be our principal strategy going forward in the face of the critical IA and II problems that are beginning to emerge. We need to solve IA and II problems on their own merits, not as a mere corollary to a human-imitative AI agenda.",
    lastp:"AI will also remain quite essential because, for the foreseeable future, computers will not be able to match humans in their ability to reason abstractly about real-world situations. We will need well-thought-out interactions between humans and computers to solve our most pressing problems. And we will want computers to trigger new levels of human creativity, not replace human creativity Moreover, we should embrace the fact that what we are witnessing is the creation of a new branch of engineering. The term “engineering” is often invoked in a narrow sense — in academia and beyond — with overtones of cold, affectless machinery, and negative connotations of loss of control by humans. But an engineering discipline can be what we want it to be. I will resist giving this emerging discipline a name, but if the acronym “AI” continues to be used as placeholder nomenclature going forward, let’s be aware of the very real limitations of this placeholder. Let’s broaden our scope, tone down the hype, and recognize the serious challenges ahead and also answer the question for “Why choose from a thousand job applications when AI can do it for you?”",

    title: 'Brain Drain from India',
    category: 'Economics and Development',
    subCategory: ['globalization', 'socialIssue', 'governance'],
    description:
      "Let me firstly explain what is Brain Drain by giving an example, As we all know that there was a recent news that Twitter's Jack Dorsey had announced that he would be stepping down from his role and Parag Agarwal, who is an IIT-Bombay pass out will be joining as the new CEO there are many more such examples of an Indian origin person becoming the CEO of an foreign company like Satya Nadela becoming the CEO of Microsoft after 2014, Sundar Pichai becoming the CEO of Alphabet in 2015, Santanu Narayen, CEO of Adobe since 2007, Arvind Krishna, CEO of IBM in 2020 and many more, this is something we Indian's are really proud about becoming successful and proving ourselves in other countries, but also at the same time some people give it the name of 'Brain Drain'. On this even Elon Musk tweeted by saying that 'USA benefits greatly from Indian talent!' even though this does not sound good to hear, but still this tweet has some bitter truth, because over more than 6 lakh Indians have given up Indian citizenship since 2017 and over more than 3 crore people have migrated to other countries in spite of the pandemic; now one must be thinking that out of the 135 crore population of the country even if 3 crores have left then what's the big deal! but according to the Global Wealth Migration Review 7000 ultra-rich Indians left the country in 2019 & India ranks 2nd in terms of the places that the rich are leaving after China, how is this important? these were the people who had the capability of creating job opportunities or employment, thereby helping the country in terms of hundreds of crores of taxes and also boosting the economy through which the foreign countries are being benefitted now.",
    paragraph:"Now, a what are the reasons behind this Brain Drain? Why every educated Indian thinks of settling in the foreign!, why it is being said that Indian Entrepreneurs are on the Run? & what is it that the foreign countries have and India doesn't? Most of us blame caste reservation for Brain drain but truly it has no role to play in it. One might find n number of examples of a person of Indian origin becoming the CEO o a , foreign company in countries like America -   is also called the land of opportunities, Europe but there are hardly such examples in Asian countries like  China, which japan, UAE and even India. This is because Asian countries have a closed culture and the people are not readily accepting or we can say that European countries have accepted the ideology of Cosmopolitanism while Asian countries have not, this culture is so closed in India that even an Indian hardly gets a chance of becoming the CEO of an Indian company and the reason is that most of the Indian Companies have a family business like Adani, Tata, Birla, Bajaj, Mahindra & only family members have the rights to the top positions in the company this also shows lack of meritocracy because for an IIT graduate it is tougher becoming the CEO of Bajaj, Mahindra than becoming the CEO of Google.", 
    subparagraph:"There is also a point which needs to be noted that there is no such Indian Institute labor ranks in the top 100 of QS World University Rankings, so the students are always in the flight mode for higher education; And also one interesting point to note that all the Indian CEO's have an Engineering background either in the software or the IT field so it can be interpreted that there is high scope of Engineering in India but that's not the ground reality; according to a survey of Aspiring minds 95% engineers in India are unfit for software development jobs and the same kind of review was received from the CEO of Tech Mahindra. The reason behind in  drain of skinned the brain can also be due to the wage gap as according to the Purchasing Power Parity (PPP) the average wages abroad are 3-4 times than in  more th an India, and there are many more such reasons including lifestyle and healthcare facilities why Brain Drain in India is increasing rapidly. India also suffers from Brain Drain due to casteism, communalism, regionalism & nepotism.",
    lastp:"In the early 1990's there was new concept was introduced called the 'reverse brain drain' at the time when India's economy was at its peak while the developed countries were struggling with their economy, but today the conditions are different, still,1990s the government can take some basic steps to reverse brain drain, In conclusion, I would like to say that Brain Drain is better than Drain in the Brain by which I mean that there is no use of making people stay in the country and asking them to look for opportunities within the country only. If people feel that there are more opportunities abroad where they can better utilize their talent then they should be allowed to do so and not forced to use their talents only in India, because instead of wasting talent it is better that it is used somewhere & The focus should be on building better opportunities rather than reducing them and developing the country.",
